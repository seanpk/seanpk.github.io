# About composing it (also)

It used to be said that people _architected_ software systems (actually, that's pretty much what's said most of the time today).  
With “Web 2.0”, _mashups_ became “the thing” (or, at least _a_ thing).

To me, neither properly captures the ideal for software.  
“Architecture” implies a lot of up-front effort and custom-built components, while “mashup” seems too informal and ephemeral. On top of that, neither term accurately describes the way software is being created today.

I think the ideal for software, a medium so malleable and infinitely reusable, is **composition**.

We see composition in action in so many major software packages today, such as Node.js (and it’s ecosystem), Google Android, and even automotive software.  Composition is the result mixing your special ideas with a bunch of well-knowns, and it is facilitated by “open technology”, i.e. open standards and open source – both together whenever possible.

Plus, “composition” has a lovely connection with musical composition, and what software maker wouldn’t be inspired by the success of music composers!
