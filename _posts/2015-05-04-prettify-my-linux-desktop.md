May the Fourth be with you!

Ubuntu's Unity always forces me to make .desktop files for programs I download directly from the web. I just _have_ to have a pretty icon in my launcher! Of course, it's also for utility: if I've downloaded from the web, I probably want to use it, and that means one click is a good thing!

Since this happens semi-frequently, I thought I'd capture the two I just created this morning in gists for "our" future reference. (If I remember, when I get home, I'll add another for Minecraft.)
